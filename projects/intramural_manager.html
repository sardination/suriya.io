    <h2>Intramural Manager</h2>

    <p>I originally created Intramural Manager to help me run the intramural program at Harvard by centralizing the communication and information point for team members, team captains, players, referees, league heads, and emergency medical services. All the features are generalized, but were implemented in order to support certain features unique to Harvard's intramural program. For example, we had permanent teams (houses) that competed against each other for every single sport and points were assigned for wins, losses, ties, and forfeits in each of these games, which ultimately counted towards a trophy that was won by a single house at the end of the year.</p>

    <p>Despite this, Intramural Manager is completely generalized and can be used for any league. If you are interested in purchasing a license to Intramural Manager, please contact Suriya at <img style="height: 1em" src="../media/img/email_address.png" />. I am open to including new features and customizing styles, so please indicate what you are looking for in your email!</p>
